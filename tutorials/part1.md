# Part 1: Vue Setup

If you are using nvm, be sure to:

```
nvm use stable
```

Then:

```
cd photo-bomb
```

**Substitute your own directory above.**

Now run vue create:

```
vue create front-end
```

It will ask you some questions. **Choose `Manually select features` and select
`Vue 2.x` and `Router` with the space bar.**

This creates a Vue CLI setup with using Vue 2.x and Vue Router, webpack, and linting.

Kindly proceed to [Part 2](/tutorials/part2.md).
